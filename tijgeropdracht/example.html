                i need some text please, for a picture... "and it's not really that bad, just i was having a fit.

                pretty sure i cried about 3 times, for like 10 minutes each time.

                weird i know, but no one has ever gotten my kids with this stuff.

                Not like, so much, but like, well, we don't get out much, so if they got out it would probably be awesome.

                Plus, this weekend, we were invited to go play laser tag in a new place here, it's called somewhere fun, like "fun warehouse" or "the laser tag place where we went last time".

                there's not much we're going to do in between party and play laser tag, but for some reason, i'm still torn about that.

                Actually, to tell you the truth, i haven't even decided, because no one has ever been more than like, oh what do you guys want to do for the party and it's always "well i don't know" or "you guys should think about it" and i've never heard anyone say "hi can we get pizza tonight?" (which is what i would do if i thought about pizza for longer than the next week, because that is absolutely the only thing i could do on a daily basis)
