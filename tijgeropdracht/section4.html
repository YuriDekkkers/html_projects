                i have to get another text please, my other bff has been out of state for a week and i haven't gotten a text back.

                i saw her last tuesday, she called and i asked if she had a text from you for me, she said no, so i asked her what she wanted, and she said, "she just wanted to know if she should bring me something back from dinner, and i said, yes, bring me two boxes of frozen french fries."

                so, that means that she got 2 frozen fries for me, and then she never called me back.

                Please text her back, i am sending you a picture of the back of my car where the messages are stuck in the bumper, so if she texts me in her own car and i can't respond.

                Just got a text for you from my bff.... i cant write right now.... can i call back at 3pm?

                my friend is having an interview today, and she will be out of town.

                i am getting really nervous, because her boyfriend left her last week and she lost her job, i am sure it has been stressful for her.

                if she didn't text me today.
